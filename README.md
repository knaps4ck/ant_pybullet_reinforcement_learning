# Ant PyBullet Reinforcement learning
In this project I successfully trained an deep learning model to control Ant in PyBullet environment using Proximal policy optimizaiton whose inputs are PyBullet environment and hyperparameters, I train 4-legged ANT to walk without falling. I used Mlp policy which implements Actor-critic to train the model to control ANT with different hyperparameters values. I have experimented with different hyperparameters, step size, time steps, learning rate and gamma. Finally, by experimenting and producing different values for model I was able to successfully train the model and after tuning the hyperparameters I was able to reach the optimal training model.
